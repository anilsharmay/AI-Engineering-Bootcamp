            "Response: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to a situation where a CEO or startup founder, who used to work in a particular specialty or function (such as product management, sales, or marketing), ends up hiring a weak executive to run that same function. This problem arises because the CEO has a hard time letting go of the function that originally brought them success and wants to remain \"the man\" or the key person in that area. The term is named after Michael Eisner, the CEO of Disney who was previously a brilliant TV network executive; when he bought ABC at Disney, ABC fell to fourth place, and instead of hiring a strong executive to turn it around, Eisner believed he could fix it himself if he had extra time, which he did not. This example illustrates how hiring a weak executive in a former specialty can lead to poor organizational performance, as described in Source 1.\n",

              "Based on the YouTube video transcript (Video ID: zjkBMFhNj_g), the speaker emphasizes that tool use is a major and evolving aspect of how language models function. They explain that it is not just about generating words internally (\"working in your head and sampling words\"), but increasingly about integrating tools and existing computing infrastructure with language. This integration allows models to solve problems more effectively by using various tools, similar to how humans rely on external resources rather than just their minds alone (Source 1, Source 2).\n",
              "\n",
              "The speaker also illustrates this with an example where \"di\" was used as a tool to generate an image, showing the practical application of tool use in problem-solving. They highlight that language models' ability to use tools is closely related to human problem-solving methods, where the use of computers and tools is common (Source 2).\n",
              "\n",
              "Furthermore, the speaker touches on the complexity and potency of tool use in language models, mentioning jailbreak situations where language models like Claude may refuse direct harmful requests (e.g., cutting down a stop sign) but might provide instructions if the request is obfuscated or encoded. This demonstrates the challenges in preventing misuse given the powerful and complex nature of tool interactions within language models (Source 3).\n",
