For example, if you ask a model like Claude directly how to do something harmful, it will refuse, but if you use a certain coded or optimized suffix of words (referred to as a \"universal transferable suffix\"), the model may then provide the harmful information. This suffix was discovered through an optimization process by researchers, not written by a person, and can be attached to various prompts to jailbreak the model.\n",

        "✅ **YouTube Transcript Ingestion**: Created a `YouTubeTranscriptLoader` that can extract existing transcripts from YouTube videos\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Proper error messages for videos without transcripts, disabled transcripts, or unavailable videos\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Metadata-Rich Vector Database**: Enhanced the vector database to store video metadata alongside embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **YouTube-Aware RAG Pipeline**: Created a specialized RAG pipeline that provides context about the video source\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Complete Integration**: Seamlessly integrated YouTube transcript processing with the existing RAG workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features:**\n",
        "- 🎥 **Single Video Focus**: Optimized for processing one YouTube video at a time\n",
        "- 🛡️ **Robust Error Handling**: Clear messages when videos cannot be processed\n",
        "- 📊 **Rich Metadata**: Tracks video ID, URL, language, segment count, and more\n",
        "- 🔍 **Contextual Responses**: RAG pipeline knows it's working with YouTube content\n",
        "- ⚡ **Efficient Processing**: Uses existing transcripts instead of audio transcription\n",
        "\n",
        "**To use this enhancement:**\n",
        "1. Replace the example URL with a YouTube video that has transcripts\n",
        "2. Run the cells to load the transcript and create the RAG pipeline\n",
        "3. Ask questions about the video content using the `youtube_rag_pipeline`\n"
